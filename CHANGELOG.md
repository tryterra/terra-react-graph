### Added

- Terra SDK support for Graph API
- It allows you to use Graph API for SDK users (Apple Health, Samsung). It automatically generates an interactive graph of the user health data. You can generate and use the graph by creating a component <TerraGraph> with the related health data type, time range specified and a graph token generated in your backend as the inputs.
